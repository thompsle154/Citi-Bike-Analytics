# Citi-Bike-Analytics

Work In Progress - This site is listed on my resume, but it is not employer ready at this time.

A dashboard of user stories with visualizations using Tableau was created to analyze a bike station dataset. 
o	Multi-line charts, scatterplots, bar charts, and maps were used to evaluate the data. Analysis was done on the most popular station, comparisons of bike times and locations, and customer trends.
